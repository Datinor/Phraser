XXVIII   MRS. JOHNSON TO LADY SUSAN   Edward Street. My dearest Friend,--I write in the greatest distress. the most unfortunate event has just taken place. Johnson has hit on the most effectual manner of plaguing us all. He had heard, I imagine, by some means or other, that you were soon to be in London, and immediately contrived to have such an attack of the gout as must at least delay his journey to Bath, if not wholly prevent it.
