Nothing is wanting but to have you here, and it is our particular wish and entreaty that you would come to us as soon as you can. You have owed us a visit many long weeks. I hope nothing will make it inconvenient to Vernon. and pray bring all my grandchildren. and your dear niece is included, of course.
