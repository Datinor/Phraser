nothing but my being in the utmost distress for money should have extorted it from me. I can get you, however, a nice drawingroom apartment in Upper Seymour Street, and we may be always together there or here. for I consider my promise to Johnson as comprehending only (at least in his absence) your not sleeping in the house. Poor Mainwaring gives me such histories of his wife's jealousy. Silly woman to expect constancy from so charming a man!
