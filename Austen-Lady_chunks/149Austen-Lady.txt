I am satisfied, and will trouble you no more when these few lines are dismissed. The engagement which you were eager to form a fortnight ago is no longer compatible with your views, and I rejoice to find that the prudent advice of your parents has not been given in vain. Your restoration to peace will, I doubt not, speedily follow this act of filial obedience, and I flatter myself with the hope of surviving my share in this disappointment. S. V.      XXXVIII   MRS. JOHNSON TO LADY SUSAN VERNON   Edward Street   I am grieved, though I cannot be astonished at your rupture with Mr. De Courcy. he has just informed Johnson of it by letter.
