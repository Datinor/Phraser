I am persuaded the gout is brought on or kept off at pleasure. it was the same when I wanted to join the Hamiltons to the Lakes. and three years ago, when I had a fancy for Bath, nothing could induce him to have a gouty symptom. I am pleased to find that my letter had so much effect on you, and that De Courcy is certainly your own. Let me hear from you as soon as you arrive, and in particular tell me what you mean to do with Mainwaring.
