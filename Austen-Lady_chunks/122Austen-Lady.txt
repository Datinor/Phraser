Yours ever,  ALICIA. XXIX   LADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON   Upper Seymour Street. My dear Alicia,--There needed not this last fit of the gout to make me detest Johnson, but now the extent of my aversion is not to be estimated. To have you confined as nurse in his apartment! My dear Alicia, of what a mistake were you guilty in marrying a man of his age!
