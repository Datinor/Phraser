I must torment my sisterinlaw for the insolent triumph of her look and manner since Sir James has been dismissed. for, in reconciling Reginald to me, I was not able to save that illfated young man. and I must make myself amends for the humiliation to which I have stooped within these few days. To effect all this I have various plans. I have also an idea of being soon in town.
