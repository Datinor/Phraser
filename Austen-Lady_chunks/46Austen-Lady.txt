As for Reginald, I believe he does not know what to make of the matter. When Sir James came, he appeared all astonishment and perplexity. the folly of the young man and the confusion of Frederica entirely engrossed him. and though a little private discourse with Lady Susan has since had its effect, he is still hurt, I am sure, at her allowing of such a man's attentions to her daughter. Sir James invited himself with great composure to remain here a few days--hoped we would not think it odd, was aware of its being very impertinent, but he took the liberty of a relation.
