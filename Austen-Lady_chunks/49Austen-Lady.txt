Adieu, my dear mother. Yours, &c.,  C. VERNON. XXI   MISS VERNON TO MR DE COURCY   Sir,--I hope you will excuse this liberty. I am forced upon it by the greatest distress, or I should be ashamed to trouble you. I am very miserable about Sir James Martin, and have no other way in the world of helping myself but by writing to you, for I am forbidden even speaking to my uncle and aunt on the subject.
