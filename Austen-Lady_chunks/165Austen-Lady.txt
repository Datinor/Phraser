Very little assistance to the State could be derived from the epistolary intercourse of Mrs. Vernon and her niece. for the former soon perceived, by the style of Frederica's letters, that they were written under her mother's inspection! and therefore, deferring all particular enquiry till she could make it personally in London, ceased writing minutely or often. Having learnt enough, in the meanwhile, from her openhearted brother, of what had passed between him and Lady Susan to sink the latter lower than ever in her opinion, she was proportionably more anxious to get Frederica removed from such a mother, and placed under her own care. and, though with little hope of success, was resolved to leave nothing unattempted that might offer a chance of obtaining her sisterinlaw's consent to it.
