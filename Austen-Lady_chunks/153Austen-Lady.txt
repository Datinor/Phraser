Your sincerely attached  ALICIA. XXXIX   LADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON   Upper Seymour Street. My dear Alicia,--I yield to the necessity which parts us. Under circumstances you could not act otherwise. Our friendship cannot be impaired by it, and in happier times, when your situation is as independent as mine, it will unite us again in the same intimacy as ever.
