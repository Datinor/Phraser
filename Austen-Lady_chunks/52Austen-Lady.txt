I am, Sir, your most humble servant,  F. S. V.      XXII   LADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON   Churchhill. This is insufferable! My dearest friend, I was never so enraged before, and must relieve myself by writing to you, who I know will enter into all my feelings. Who should come on Tuesday but Sir James Martin! Guess my astonishment, and vexation--for, as you well know, I never wished him to be seen at Churchhill.
