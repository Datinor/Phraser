The case was this--Frederica had set herself violently against marrying Sir James. And can your ladyship wonder that she should? Frederica has an excellent understanding, and Sir James has none. I am at least very far from regretting it, my dear sister, on the contrary, I am grateful for so favourable a sign of my daughter's sense. Sir James is certainly below par (his boyish manners make him appear worse).
