I remember saying to myself, as I drove to the house,  I like this man, pray Heaven no harm come of it!  But I was determined to be discreet, to bear in mind my being only four months a widow, and to be as quiet as possible: and I have been so, my dear creature. I have admitted no one's attentions but Mainwaring's. I have avoided all general flirtation whatever.
