My dear aunt, you do not know how miserable I have been. Frederica you ought to have told me all your distresses. You would have found in me a friend always ready to assist you. Do you think that your uncle or I should not have espoused your cause as warmly as my brother? Indeed, I did not doubt your kindness, but I thought De Courcy could do anything with my mother.
