But, since it must be so, I am obliged to declare that all the accounts of your misconduct during the life, and since the death of Vernon, which had reached me, in common with the world in general, and gained my entire belief before I saw you, but which you, by the exertion of your perverted abilities, had made me resolved to disallow, have been unanswerably proved to me. nay more, I am assured that a connection, of which I had never before entertained a thought, has for some time existed, and still continues to exist, between you and the man whose family you robbed of its peace in return for the hospitality with which you were received into it. that you have corresponded with him ever since your leaving Langford. not with his wife, but with him, and that he now visits you every day. Can you, dare you deny it?
