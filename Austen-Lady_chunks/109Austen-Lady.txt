When my own will is effected contrary to his, I shall have some credit in being on good terms with Reginald, which at present, in fact, I have not. for though he is still in my power, I have given up the very article by which our quarrel was produced, and at best the honour of victory is doubtful. Send me your opinion on all these matters, my dear Alicia, and let me know whether you can get lodgings to suit me within a short distance of you. Your most attached  S. VERNON. XXVI   MRS. JOHNSON TO LADY SUSAN   Edward Street.
