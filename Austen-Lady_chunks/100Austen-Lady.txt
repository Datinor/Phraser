I reproach myself for having, even though innocently, made her unhappy on that score. She shall have all the retribution in my power to make. if she value her own happiness as much as I do, if she judge wisely, and command herself as she ought, she may now be easy. Excuse me, my dearest sister, for thus trespassing on your time, but I owe it to my own character. and after this explanation I trust I am in no danger of sinking in your opinion.
