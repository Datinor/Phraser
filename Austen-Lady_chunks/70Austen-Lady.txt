I find from Wilson that we are going to lose De Courcy--is it true that he leaves Churchhill this morning?  I replied that it was.  He told us nothing of all this last night, or even this morning at breakfast. but perhaps he did not know it himself. Young men are often hasty in their resolutions, and not more sudden in forming than unsteady in keeping them.
