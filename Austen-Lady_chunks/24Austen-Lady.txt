I remain, &c., &c.,  CATHERINE VERNON. XVIII   FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME   Churchhill. My dear Mother,--I am very glad to find that my description of Frederica Vernon has interested you, for I do believe her truly deserving of your regard. and when I have communicated a notion which has recently struck me, your kind impressions in her favour will, I am sure, be heightened. I cannot help fancying that she is growing partial to my brother.
