At length Lady Susan, weary, I believe, of her situation, proposed walking. and we left the two gentlemen together, to put on our pelisses. As we went upstairs Lady Susan begged permission to attend me for a few moments in my dressingroom, as she was anxious to speak with me in private. I led her thither accordingly, and as soon as the door was closed, she said:  I was never more surprized in my life than by Sir James's arrival, and the suddenness of it requires some apology to you, my dear sister.
