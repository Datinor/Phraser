I received my information in Johnson's house, from Mrs. Mainwaring herself. You know how I have loved you. you can intimately judge of my present feelings, but I am not so weak as to find indulgence in describing them to a woman who will glory in having excited their anguish, but whose affection they have never been able to gain. R. DE COURCY. XXXV   LADY SUSAN TO MR. DE COURCY   Upper Seymour Street.
