Your affectionate mother,  C. DE COURCY      XLI   MRS. VERNON TO LADY DE COURCY   Churchhill. My dear Mother,--Your letter has surprized me beyond measure! Can it be true that they are really separated--and for ever? I should be overjoyed if I dared depend on it, but after all that I have seen how can one be secure. And Reginald really with you!
