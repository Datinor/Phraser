Miss Nash had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great delight. Perry had been to Goddard's to attend a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Elton, and found to his great surprize, that Elton was actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the whistclub night, which he had been never known to miss before. and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day. but it would not do. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a very particular way indeed, that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world.
