My friend Robert could not resist. They called for him in their way. were all extremely amused. and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day--which he did--and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet. and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is deserving.
