  At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much astonished now at Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.   We are sure of excellent fires, and every thing in the greatest comfort. Charming people, and Weston.--Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society.--it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any. Weston's diningroom does not accommodate more than ten comfortably.
