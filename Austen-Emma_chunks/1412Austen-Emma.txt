As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad, I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour to read--or my poem. I shall do something to expose myself. That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to Swisserland.
