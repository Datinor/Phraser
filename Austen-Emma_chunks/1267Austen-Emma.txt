Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith. Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Weston. You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your command--but my dancing days are over.   Weston said no more.
