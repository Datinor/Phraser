I was going to observe, sir, that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body's catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls! Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could. Sir, you are very much mistaken if you suppose Perry to be that sort of character. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house.
