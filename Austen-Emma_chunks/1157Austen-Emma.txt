You are afraid of giving me trouble. but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the lookout for any thing eligible. Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her. till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body trouble.
