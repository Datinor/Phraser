My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the postoffice in the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.   Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.   Oh! do not tell me. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know how to take care of yourself.--To the postoffice indeed!
