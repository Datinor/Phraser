though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any family of that name? To be sure we do, Bates--we passed her house--I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax. I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl she is.
