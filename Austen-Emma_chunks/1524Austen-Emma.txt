Miss Bates was obliged to return without success. Jane was quite unpersuadable. the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers. but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.
