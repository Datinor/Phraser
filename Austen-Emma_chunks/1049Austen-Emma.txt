and my particular friend, Partridge, the lady I have always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public with.   It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of her being indebted to Elton for what was called an introduction--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed! She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have given, and only thanked Elton coolly.  but their going to Bath was quite out of the question.
