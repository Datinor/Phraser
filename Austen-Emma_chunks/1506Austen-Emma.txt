And poor John's son came to talk to Elton about relief from the parish. he is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help. and so, when Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Elton.
