Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance. and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple.   You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five, And there will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Knightley.
