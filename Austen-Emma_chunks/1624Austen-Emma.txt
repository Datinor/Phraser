Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Weston to invite her to an airing. she had drawn back and declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded. and, in the course of their drive, Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject. Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Weston, must necessarily open the cause. but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement.
