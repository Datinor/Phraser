Yes--I have some right to that knowledge. though I have never been at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account. for I do believe her to be very fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her way--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection.
