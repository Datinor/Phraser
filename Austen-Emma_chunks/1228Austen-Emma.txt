What were nine miles to a young man?--An hour's ride. He would be always coming over. The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchesterstreet--was a serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning.
