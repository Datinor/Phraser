Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago. which is saying a great deal at my mother's time of life--and it really is full two years, you know, since she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and as I was telling Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now. Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?
