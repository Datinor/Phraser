I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married. We must ask and Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is here. Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she is coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing. It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case of necessity.
