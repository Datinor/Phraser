I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very day se'nnight.   John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly,   I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.
