We explored to King'sWeston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the barouchelandau. You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer? No. not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of.
