I have no faith in Elton's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed. or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of goodbreeding. I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise, encouragement, and offers of service. that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouchelandau. Jane Fairfax has feeling, I do not accuse her of want of feeling.
