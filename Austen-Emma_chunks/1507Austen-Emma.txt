  Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her. but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Frank Churchill's going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence. What Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected. and that Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable account of Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early. but that Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace, and driving very steady.
