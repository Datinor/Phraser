There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present, as can well be. and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Woodhouse's account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.   Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable to have them suspected.
