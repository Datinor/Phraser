My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the diningroom. The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is best observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house. Well--as you please. only don't have a great set out.
