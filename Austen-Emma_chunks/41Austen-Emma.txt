Captain Weston was a general favourite. and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend. Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the familyestate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of and Churchill, who threw her off with due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much happiness. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him.
