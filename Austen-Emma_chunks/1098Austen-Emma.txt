Such attentions as Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Elton's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting. I should not wonder, if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness in accepting Elton's civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in spite of the very natural wish of a little change.   Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again.
