Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature he is.--I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint, oldfashioned politeness. it is much more to my taste than modern ease. modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.
