Selina has entirely given up music--never touches the instrument--though she played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and James Cooper. and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with Selina.
