Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I have a great regard for him. he was clerk to my poor father twentyseven years. and now, poor old man, he is bedridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints--I must go and see him today. and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all.
