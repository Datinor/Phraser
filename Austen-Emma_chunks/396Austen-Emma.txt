What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different. but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree. If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always think alike. To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong.
