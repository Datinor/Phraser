Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family as much as you chose.--that is--I do not know--if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure. but you sing as well as play.--yes, I really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose.--and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest. You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a situation together, they are pretty sure to be equal. however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer.
