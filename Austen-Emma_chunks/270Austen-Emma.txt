Miss Nash, headteacher at Goddard's, had written out at least three hundred. and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste. and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in.
