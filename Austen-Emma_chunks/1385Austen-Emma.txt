He should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet and Elton, and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his, and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. He thought it very well done of Knightley to invite them--very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out.   Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence. The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it. and Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible.
