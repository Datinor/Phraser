Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it.

Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.
