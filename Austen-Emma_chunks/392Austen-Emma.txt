Weston is rather an easy, cheerfultempered man, than a man of strong feelings. he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that home affords.   Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Weston, and had half a mind to take it up. but she struggled, and let it pass. She would keep the peace if possible.
