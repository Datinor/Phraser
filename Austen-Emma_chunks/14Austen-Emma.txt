But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way.--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit? They are to be put into Weston's stable, papa. You know we have settled all that already. We talked it all over with Weston last night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there.
