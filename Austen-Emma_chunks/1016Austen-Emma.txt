think less, talk less of Elton for my sake. because for your own sake rather, I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my comfort, a habit of selfcommand in you, a consideration of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity. These are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very important--and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.
