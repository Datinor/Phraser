Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself. and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of selfexamination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her. But  she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.  These were her reasons--she had no better.
