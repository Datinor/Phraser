Knightley!--I could not have believed it. Knightley!--never seen him in her life before, and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart, vulgar being, with her E., and her caro sposo, and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery. Actually to discover that Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady.
