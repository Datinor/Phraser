and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of others--she objected only to a tetea-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved, and was grateful. This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping or waking, the last twentyfour hours--Weston, who had been calling on her daughterinlaw elect, and took Hartfield in her way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview. Weston had accompanied her to Bates's, and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely. but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded. A little curiosity Emma had.
