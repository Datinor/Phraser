It is such a happiness when good people get together--and they always do. Now, here will be Elton and Miss Hawkins. and there are the Coles, such very good people. and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than and Perry. I say, sir, I think there are few places with such society as Highbury.
