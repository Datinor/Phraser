Poor and Miss Woodhouse, if you please. but I cannot possibly say 'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma. but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two. Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!
