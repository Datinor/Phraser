Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins, was less and less at Hartfield. which was not to be regretted.--The intimacy between her and Emma must sink. their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill. and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner. Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no remembrances, even connected with Elton as he stood before them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.
