I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine his age to be? He was fourandtwenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd. Only fourandtwenty.
