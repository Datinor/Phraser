As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper. and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him--but there was no getting away, no pause. and, to my utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly threequarters of an hour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.
