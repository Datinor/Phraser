One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before one decides upon what he can do, One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family. but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules: she is so very unreasonable. and every thing gives way to her. But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. Now, according to my idea of Churchill, it would be most natural, that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards him, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all.
