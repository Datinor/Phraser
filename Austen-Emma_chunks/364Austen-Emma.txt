Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention. and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join them. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail. and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beetroot, and all the dessert.   This would soon have led to something better, of course, any thing interests between those who love.
