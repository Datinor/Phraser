Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little did I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself. however, she called me back presently, and let me look too, which was very goodnatured. And how beautiful we thought he looked!
