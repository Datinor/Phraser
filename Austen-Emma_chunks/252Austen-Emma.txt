But as to my letting her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible. she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it may be. and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little. but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.
