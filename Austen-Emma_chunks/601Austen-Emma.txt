Such was Jane Fairfax's history. She had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent education. Living constantly with rightminded and wellinformed people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture. and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of firstrate masters. Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do.
