Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what is. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanitybaits for poor young ladies. My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common politeness and goodbreeding, and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry.   Emma had done.
