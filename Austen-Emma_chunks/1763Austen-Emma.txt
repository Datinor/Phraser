The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear E., he must have left a message for you, I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric.--and his servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And as for Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it. I met William Larkins, as I got near the house, and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the speech of him.
