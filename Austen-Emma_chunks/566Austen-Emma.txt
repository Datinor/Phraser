Elton is so good to the poor! Cole had just been there, just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much. and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.   The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Elton. There was intimacy between them, and Cole had heard from Elton since his going away.
