After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--and it was,  How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--How has Wright done my hair? --with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. Elton then said,  Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior to others.
