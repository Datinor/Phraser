I thought I had seen you first in February. Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)--nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people. I say nothing of which I am ashamed, I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can.
