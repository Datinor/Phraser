This is meeting quite in fairyland!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.--She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--and Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Hughes for a moment.--How do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you.
