Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives? No--pray let her have time to look about her. I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy, though I have kept my thoughts to myself. but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.
