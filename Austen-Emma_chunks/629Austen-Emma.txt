I hope every body had a pleasant evening, I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much. but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me. Miss Bates was very chatty and goodhumoured, as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way.
