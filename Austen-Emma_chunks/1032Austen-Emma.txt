--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty. and the house was modern and wellbuilt. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or imagine.  Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morningroom at Maple Grove.
