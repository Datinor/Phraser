It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account. and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, prettyspoken girl. I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner. and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.
