I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility. To be sure, he is not so genteel as real gentlemen. I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Martin. At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company with Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before.
