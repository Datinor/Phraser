Knightley was there too, was he? No, not Knightley. he declined it from the first. and though I thought he would come, because Elton declared she would not let him off, he did not.--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.
