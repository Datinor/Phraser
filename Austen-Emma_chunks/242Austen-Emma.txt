nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me. that she associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will deny.--She is superior to Robert Martin. Whoever might be her parents, whoever may have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Goddard's hands to shift as she can.--to move, in short, in Goddard's line, to have Goddard's acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her.
