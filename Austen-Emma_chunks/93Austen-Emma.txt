Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old! Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not born to an independence. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth. and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet.
