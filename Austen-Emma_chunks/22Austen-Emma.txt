It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding. By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations. but I hope it all went off tolerably well.
