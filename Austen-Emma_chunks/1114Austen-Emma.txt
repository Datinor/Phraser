From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have been at a loss.   No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made eveningparties perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at routcakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury cardparties. Bates, Perry, Goddard and others, were a good deal behindhand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged.
