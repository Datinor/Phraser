Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so attentive to them!   Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise. and with a smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.--It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.-- He looked at her with a glow of regard.
