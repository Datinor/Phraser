How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?--Emma, I had not thought it possible.   Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.   Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it. It was not so very bad.
