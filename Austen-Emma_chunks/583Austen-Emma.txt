They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again--for till she married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Dixon's name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat, Balycraig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty. from Dixon, I mean--I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else. but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses--and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them--for Colonel and Campbell were very particular about their daughter's not walking out often with only Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them. of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland.
