Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should make Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his hurrying away.

He wished the road might be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls.
