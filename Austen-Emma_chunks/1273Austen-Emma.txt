Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused, and who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall Jane. I left her dancing with George Otway. she will love to tell you all about it herself tomorrow: her first partner was Elton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps William Cox.'
