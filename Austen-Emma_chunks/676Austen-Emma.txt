I was always glad he did not come at Christmas. now we are going to have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall enjoy him completely. every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish.   There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Weston's, confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not less to the purpose.
