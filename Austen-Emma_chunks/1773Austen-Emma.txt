It would be a great comfort to Weston, as he grew older--and even Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home. and Weston--no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her. and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have their powers in exercise again.   She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me, like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, in Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan. That is, she will indulge her even more than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all.
