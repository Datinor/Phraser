I know no man more likely than Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing really goodnatured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one. and this, considering Jane Fairfax's illhealth, would appear a case of humanity to him.--and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Knightley. I know he had horses today--for we arrived together. and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that could betray.
