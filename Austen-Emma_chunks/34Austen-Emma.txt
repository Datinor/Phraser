and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off matchmaking. I do not understand what you mean by 'success,' Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success?
