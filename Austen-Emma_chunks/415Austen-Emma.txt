I cannot compliment you. I think John Knightley very far from looking well. What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me? I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Wingfield before you left home.
