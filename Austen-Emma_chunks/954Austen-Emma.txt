I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for Perry. My father and Weston are at the Crown at this moment, examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there.
