I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol, 'I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouchelandau without a companion. but Augusta, I believe, with her own goodwill, would never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has she said so.
