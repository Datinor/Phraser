Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write. Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any exercise.   Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better. but it was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Bates's, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--but it would not do.--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service--and every thing that message could do was tried--but all in vain.
