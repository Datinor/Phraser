Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm. And I, Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she is an excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no.
