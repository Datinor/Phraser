Happy couple! How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!--for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any public place, can give--it is all nothing. there can be no knowledge. It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form any just judgment.
