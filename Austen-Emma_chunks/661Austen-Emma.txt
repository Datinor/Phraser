Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened! She had set out from Goddard's half an hour ago--she had been afraid it would rain--she had been afraid it would pour down every moment--but she thought she might get to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible. but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step in and see how it went on. and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she did not know what to do. so she ran on directly, as fast as she could, and took shelter at Ford's.
