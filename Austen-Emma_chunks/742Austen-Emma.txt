Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and lively one. she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal decidedly right. he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of talking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself. and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect.
