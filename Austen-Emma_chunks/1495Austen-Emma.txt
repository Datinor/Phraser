She would not let Jane say, 'No.' for when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention. exactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present--and so she told Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did.
