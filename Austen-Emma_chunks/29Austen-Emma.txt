  Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.  It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion, We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it. but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's advantage. she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married.
