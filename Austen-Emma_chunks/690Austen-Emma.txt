I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Weston. You cannot see too much perfection in Weston for my feelings, were you to guess her to be eighteen, I should listen with pleasure. but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words. Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman. I hope I should know better, no, depend upon it, (with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms.
