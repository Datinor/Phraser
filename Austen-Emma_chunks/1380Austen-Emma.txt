I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by. I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary. for, let a woman have ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home.--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and in winter there is dirt.
