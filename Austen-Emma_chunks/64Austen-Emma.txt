As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from Goddard, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her. a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion. Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed her, several years back, at Goddard's school, and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlourboarder.
