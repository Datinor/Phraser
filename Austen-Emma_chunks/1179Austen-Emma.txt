I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him. and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage. You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.-- He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a letter today. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed to me--it was to Weston.
