I hope, I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice. but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant, Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have met with. and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her.
