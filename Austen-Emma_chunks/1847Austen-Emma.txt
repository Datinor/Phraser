This was her history. and particularly interesting it was to Woodhouse, who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she had not done it.  She should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night.
