Very. I rather wonder that it was never made before. Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before. Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body. That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates's house.
