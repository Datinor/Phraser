No, indeed I do not. Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about courtplaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat--just before and John Knightley came--I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife, and your recommending courtplaister?--But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him. and so I took mine out and cut him a piece. but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me.
