It is a necessary of life to me. and having always been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I honestly said as much to E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable. and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension. When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that the world I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of retirement.
