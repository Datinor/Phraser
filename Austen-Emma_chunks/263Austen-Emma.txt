and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify. He had frightened her a little about Elton. but when she considered that Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly might have heard Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, and Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters. he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them.
