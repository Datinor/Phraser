I have quite a horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort. for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves! Your description of Churchill made me think of them directly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families.
