But what did such particulars explain?--The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin. and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible to Emma. The event, however, was most joyful. and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known. She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a connexion had she been preparing for Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Elton!--The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.
