I think very well of Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing him a service. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will be a much better thing. I dare say Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.
