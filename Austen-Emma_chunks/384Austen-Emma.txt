I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended. and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied. Why, to be sure, yes, certainly--I cannot deny that Weston, poor Weston, does come and see us pretty often--but then--she is always obliged to go away again. It would be very hard upon Weston if she did not, papa.--You quite forget poor Weston. I think, indeed, that Weston has some little claim.
