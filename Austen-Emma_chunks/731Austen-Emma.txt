You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell. but she really did not seem to feel it. So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax herself.
