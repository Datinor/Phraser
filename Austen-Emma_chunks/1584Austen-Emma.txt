Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Frank Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly. Me! Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Frank Churchill. I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject, but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him?
