Emma will be happy to entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns--my winter walk. You cannot do better, sir. I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Knightley, but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you. and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.
