It was a done thing. Elton was to go, and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment. never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her.   Well, this is most strange!--After I had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men, especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must be the case with Elton. a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet.
