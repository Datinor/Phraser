Elton's manners are not perfect, but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect goodtemper and goodwill in Elton as one cannot but value. Yes, he seems to have a great deal of goodwill towards you. Me!
