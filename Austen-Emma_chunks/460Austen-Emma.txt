But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January. What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as yourself. Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another putoff. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not know the parties so well as I do.
