Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed, At this moment, perhaps, Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name. My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bondstreet. Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Elton. No, my dear little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bondstreet till just before he mounts his horse tomorrow. It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight.
