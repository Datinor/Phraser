  Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few who knew her opinion of Elton, Weston ventured this apology for Jane.

Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for what she goes to. You are right, Weston, Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Elton.
