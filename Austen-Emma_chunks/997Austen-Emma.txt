Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said,  I shall hear about you all, that is my chief consolation. I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise it.
