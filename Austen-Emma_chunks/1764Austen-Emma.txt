I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it really is of very great importance that I should see Knightley today. and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose.   Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In all probability she was at this very time waited for there. and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Elton, if not towards William Larkins.
