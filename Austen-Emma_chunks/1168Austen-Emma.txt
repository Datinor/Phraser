I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being overtrimmed--quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity. a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the minority, I believe.
