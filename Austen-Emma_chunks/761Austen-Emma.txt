But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are goodnatured people, and think little of their own claims. but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment. and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's in the room.
