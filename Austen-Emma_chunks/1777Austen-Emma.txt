I do not believe I did you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all. and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least. I am sure you were of use to me, I was very often influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time.
