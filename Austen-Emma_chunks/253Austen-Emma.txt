His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was the brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her. and altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not, while she was at AbbeyMill, find him disagreeable. But the case is altered now.
