In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Weston were less sanguine. He ought to come, If he could stay only a couple of days, he ought to come. and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having it in his power to do as much as that. A young woman, if she fall into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with. but one cannot comprehend a young man's being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he likes it.
