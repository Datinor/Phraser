My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel.   Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both the Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself.--and two basins only were ordered. After a little more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,   It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.
