Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before  it was very true--it was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to think about them--and she would not think about them any longer Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make me. You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. It was all my doing, I know.
