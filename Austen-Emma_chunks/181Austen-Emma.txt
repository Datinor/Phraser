Harriet had been at Hartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast. and, after a time, had gone home to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a minute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to Goddard's, that Martin had been there an hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away. and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself.
