Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified. it supplied a very useful check,--interested, without disturbing him. He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.   I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably settled. Elton is very goodnatured and agreeable, and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be.
