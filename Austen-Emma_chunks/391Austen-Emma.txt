There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his parents and natural home! I never could comprehend how Weston could part with him. To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else. Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy, But you need not imagine Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John.
