the seat of Edward's most particular freind, which was but a few miles distant. At M----. we arrived in a few hours. and on sending in our names were immediately admitted to Sophia, the Wife of Edward's freind. After having been deprived during the course of 3 weeks of a real freind (for such I term your Mother) imagine my transports at beholding one, most truly worthy of the Name.
