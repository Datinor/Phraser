We had a very pleasant Dance and as Lady G--slept all the way home, I had a very comfortable ride. The next day while we were at dinner Lady Greville's Coach stopped at the door, for that is the time of day she generally contrives it should. She sent in a message by the servant to say that  she should not get out but that Miss Maria must come to the Coachdoor, as she wanted to speak to her, and that she must make haste and come immediately-- Go Maria-- Why I think Miss Maria you are not quite so smart as you were last night--But I did not come to examine your dress, but to tell you that you may dine with us the day after tomorrow--Not tomorrow, remember, do not come tomorrow, for we expect Lord and Lady Clermont and Sir Thomas Stanley's family--There will be no occasion for your being very fine for I shant send the Carriage--If it rains you may take an umbrella--
