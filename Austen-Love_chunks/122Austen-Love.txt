and in the first place I must inform you that it is confidently reported, your Father is going to be married. I am very unwilling to beleive so unpleasing a report, and at the same time cannot wholly discredit it. I have written to my freind Susan Fitzgerald, for information concerning it, which as she is at present in Town, she will be very able to give me. I know not who is the Lady. I think your Brother is extremely right in the resolution he has taken of travelling, as it will perhaps contribute to obliterate from his remembrance, those disagreable Events, which have lately so much afflicted him--I am happy to find that tho' secluded from all the World, neither you nor Matilda are dull or unhappy--that you may never know what it is to, be either is the wish of your sincerely affectionate C.L.
