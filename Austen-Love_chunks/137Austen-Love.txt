I could not help wishing all dinnertime that I had been at the dressing it--. A brother of Mrs Marlowe, Mr Cleveland is with them at present. he is a goodlooking young Man, and seems to have a good deal to say for himself. I tell Eloisa that she should set her cap at him, but she does not at all seem to relish the proposal. I should like to see the girl married and Cleveland has a very good estate.
