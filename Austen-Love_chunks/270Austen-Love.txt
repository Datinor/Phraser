Though you have often told me that Miss Millar was remarkably handsome, you never mentioned anything of her Sisters' beauty. yet they are certainly extremely pretty. I'll give you their description.--Julia is eighteen. with a countenance in which Modesty, Sense and Dignity are happily blended, she has a form which at once presents you with Grace, Elegance and Symmetry. Charlotte who is just sixteen is shorter than her Sister, and though her figure cannot boast the easy dignity of Julia's, yet it has a pleasing plumpness which is in a different way as estimable.
