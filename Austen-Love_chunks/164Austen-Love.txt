I feel very much obliged to you for keeping your admiration to yourself.  I never shall forget the very witty answer I made to this speech.  Eloisa (said I) I beg you would be quite at your Ease with respect to all such fears in future, for be assured that I shall always keep my admiration to myself and my own pursuits and never extend it to yours.  This was the only very severe thing I ever said in my Life. not but that I have often felt myself extremely satirical but it was the only time I ever made my feelings public.
