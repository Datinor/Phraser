Lady Scudamore said I, how can you talk so ridiculously? Nay, t'is very true answered she, I assure you, for he was in love with you from the first moment he beheld you. I wish it may be true said I, for that is the only kind of love I would give a farthing for--There is some sense in being in love at first sight. Well, I give you Joy of your conquest, replied Lady Scudamore, and I beleive it to have been a very complete one. I am sure it is not a contemptible one, for my Cousin is a charming young fellow, has seen a great deal of the World, and writes the best Loveletters I ever read.
