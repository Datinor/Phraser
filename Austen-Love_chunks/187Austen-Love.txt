George Austen, this work is inscribed with all due respect by THE AUTHOR. N.B. There will be very few Dates in this History. THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND   HENRY the 4th  Henry the 4th ascended the throne of England much to his own satisfaction in the year 1399, after having prevailed on his cousin and predecessor Richard the 2nd, to resign it to him, and to retire for the rest of his life to Pomfret Castle, where he happened to be murdered. It is to be supposed that Henry was married, since he had certainly four sons, but it is not in my power to inform the Reader who was his wife.
