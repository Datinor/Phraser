they lament my want of spirits. they dread the effects of both. In hopes of releiving my melancholy, by directing my thoughts to other objects, they have invited several of their freinds to spend the Christmas with us. Lady Bridget Darkwood and her sisterinlaw, Miss Jane are expected on Friday. and Colonel Seaton's family will be with us next week.
