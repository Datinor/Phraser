replied Lord St. Clair--But tell me (continued he looking fearfully towards the Door) tell me, have I any other Grandchildren in the House. None my Lord. Then I will provide for you all without farther delay--Here are 4 Banknotes of 50L each--Take them and remember I have done the Duty of a Grandfather.  He instantly left the Room and immediately afterwards the House. Adeiu, Laura.
