Happy Lady Scudamore to live within a mile of the divine Henrietta! When the lovely Creature first entered the room, oh! what were my sensations? The sight of you was like the sight ofa wonderful fine Thing. I started--I gazed at her with admiration--She appeared every moment more Charming, and the unfortunate Musgrove became a captive to your Charms before I had time to look about me.
