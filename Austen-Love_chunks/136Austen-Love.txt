Mr and Mrs Marlowe are very agreable people. the ill health of their little boy occasioned their arrival here. you may imagine that being the only family with whom we can converse, we are of course on a footing of intimacy with them. we see them indeed almost every day, and dined with them yesterday. We spent a very pleasant Day, and had a very good Dinner, tho' to be sure the Veal was terribly underdone, and the Curry had no seasoning.
