We of course mentioned you, and I assure you that ample Justice was done to your Merits by all.  Louisa Clarke (said I) is in general a very pleasant Girl, yet sometimes her good humour is clouded by Peevishness, Envy and Spite. She neither wants Understanding or is without some pretensions to Beauty, but these are so very trifling, that the value she sets on her personal charms, and the adoration she expects them to be offered are at once a striking example of her vanity, her pride, and her folly.  So said I, and to my opinion everyone added weight by the concurrence of their own. Your affectionate Arabella Smythe.
