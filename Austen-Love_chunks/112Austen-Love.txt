my dear Freind, how happy should I be to see you within these venerable Walls! It is now four years since my removal from School has separated me from you. that two such tender Hearts, so closely linked together by the ties of simpathy and Freindship, should be so widely removed from each other, is vastly moving. I live in Perthshire, You in Sussex. We might meet in London, were my Father disposed to carry me there, and were your Mother to be there at the same time.
