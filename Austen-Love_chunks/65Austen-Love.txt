The dignity of Sophia was wounded.  Wretch (exclaimed she, hastily replacing the Banknote in the Drawer) how darest thou to accuse me of an Act, of which the bare idea makes me blush?  The base wretch was still unconvinced and continued to upbraid the justlyoffended Sophia in such opprobious Language, that at length he so greatly provoked the gentle sweetness of her Nature, as to induce her to revenge herself on him by informing him of Janetta's Elopement, and of the active Part we had both taken in the affair. At this period of their Quarrel I entered the Library and was as you may imagine equally offended as Sophia at the illgrounded accusations of the malevolent and contemptible Macdonald.  Base Miscreant!
