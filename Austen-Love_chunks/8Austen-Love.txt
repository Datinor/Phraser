Beware my Laura (she would often say) Beware of the insipid Vanities and idle Dissipations of the Metropolis of England. Beware of the unmeaning Luxuries of Bath and of the stinking fish of Southampton. Alas! (exclaimed I) how am I to avoid those evils I shall never be exposed to? What probability is there of my ever tasting the Dissipations of London, the Luxuries of Bath, or the stinking Fish of Southampton?
