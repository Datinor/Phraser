If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is a something about Fanny, I have often observed it before--she likes to go her own way to work. she does not like to be dictated to. she takes her own independent walk whenever she can. she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her, which I would advise her to get the better of.   As a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be more unjust, though he had been so lately expressing the same sentiments himself, and he tried to turn the conversation: tried repeatedly before he could succeed.
