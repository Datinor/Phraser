I have had enough of the family for one morning. Why, child, I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother. Such a penance as I have been enduring, while you were sitting here so composed and so happy! It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had been in my place, but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes.   This was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and let it pass: Julia was vexed, and her temper was hasty.
