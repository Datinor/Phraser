Dr. Grant, through an interest on which he had almost ceased to form hopes, succeeded to a stall in Westminster, which, as affording an occasion for leaving Mansfield, an excuse for residence in London, and an increase of income to answer the expenses of the change, was highly acceptable to those who went and those who staid. Grant, with a temper to love and be loved, must have gone with some regret from the scenes and people she had been used to. but the same happiness of disposition must in any place, and any society, secure her a great deal to enjoy, and she had again a home to offer Mary. and Mary had had enough of her own friends, enough of vanity, ambition, love, and disappointment in the course of the last halfyear, to be in need of the true kindness of her sister's heart, and the rational tranquillity of her ways. They lived together.
