Those who are showing the world what female manners should be, are doing a great deal to set them right. The error is plain enough, such girls are ill brought up. They are given wrong notions from the beginning. They are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards. I do not know, Yes, I cannot agree with you there.
