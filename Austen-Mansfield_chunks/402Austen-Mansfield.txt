Yes. I do not know how it has happened.  The glee began.  I am rather surprised, that Crawford should come back again so soon, after being here so long before, full seven weeks. for I had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about, that I thought something would certainly occur, when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere.
