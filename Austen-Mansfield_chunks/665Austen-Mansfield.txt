There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth's manners, but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject: his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting. He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish. Yes, indeed, and the more you know of him the better you will like him. He is not a shining character, but he has a thousand good qualities. and is so disposed to look up to you, that I am quite laughed at about it, for everybody considers it as my doing.
