A mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to them. Fanny could read, work, and write, but she had been taught nothing more. and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar, they thought her prodigiously stupid, and for the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of it into the drawingroom.  Dear mama, only think, my cousin cannot put the map of Europe together--or my cousin cannot tell the principal rivers in Russia--or, she never heard of Asia Minor--or she does not know the difference between watercolours and crayons!--How strange!--Did you ever hear anything so stupid? My dear, it is very bad, but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself.
