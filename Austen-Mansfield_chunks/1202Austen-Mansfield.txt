It was really like being at a play, I wish Sir Thomas had been here.   Crawford was excessively pleased. If Lady Bertram, with all her incompetency and languor, could feel this, the inference of what her niece, alive and enlightened as she was, must feel, was elevating.   You have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Crawford, and I will tell you what, I think you will have a theatre, some time or other, at your house in Norfolk. I mean when you are settled there.
