The church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome. I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places. The annoyance of the bells must be terrible. There is the parsonage: a tidylooking house, and I understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people. Those are almshouses, built by some of the family.
