Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot attempt to defend Dr. Grant. No, but we need not give up his profession for all that. because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would have taken a--not a good temper into it. and as he must, either in the navy or army, have had a great many more people under his command than he has now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman.
