Everingham, as it used to be, was perfect in my estimation: such a happy fall of ground, and such timber! What would I not give to see it again? Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it, but I fear there would be some disappointment: you would not find it equal to your present ideas. In extent, it is a mere nothing. you would be surprised at its insignificance.
