for I believe it often happens that a man, before he has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself. Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria. and I am not at all afraid for her, after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong.   Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think differently in future. but with all that submission to Edmund could do, and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say that Julia was Crawford's choice, she knew not always what to think.
