but being her brother's present, is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it, when it is not wanted? She must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable, at least: and its having been originally her brother's gift makes no difference. for as she was not prevented from offering, nor you from taking it on that account, it ought not to prevent you from keeping it. No doubt it is handsomer than mine, and fitter for a ballroom. No, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer in its way, and, for my purpose, not half so fit.
