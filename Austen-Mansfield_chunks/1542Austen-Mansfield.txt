A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram's sheets of paper could do. There was hardly any one in the house who might not have described, from personal observation, better than herself. not one who was not more useful at times to her son. She could do nothing but glide in quietly and look at him. but when able to talk or be talked to, or read to, Edmund was the companion he preferred.
