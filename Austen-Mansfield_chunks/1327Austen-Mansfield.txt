and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been first watching her complacently, and then musing on something else, suddenly called her attention by saying:  I should like to sit talking with you here all day, but we must not forget the ladies below, and so goodbye, my dear, my amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we shall nominally part in the breakfastparlour, I must take leave of you here. And I do take leave, longing for a happy reunion, and trusting that when we meet again, it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve.   A very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner, accompanied these words.   I shall see your cousin in town soon: he talks of being there tolerably soon.
