Nothing can be easier. The meadows beyond what will be the garden, as well as what now is, sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the northeast, that is, to the principal road through the village, must be all laid together, of course. very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber. They belong to the living, I suppose. if not, you must purchase them.
