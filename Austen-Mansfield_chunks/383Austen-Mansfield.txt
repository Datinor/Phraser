There was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I was biased, but I think it was blamelessly. It is the same sort of thing, as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to be in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that.
