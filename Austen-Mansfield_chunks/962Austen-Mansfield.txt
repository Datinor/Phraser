  Fanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent. while Miss Crawford wondered she did not smile, and thought her overanxious, or thought her odd, or thought her anything rather than insensible of pleasure in Henry's attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in the course of the evening. but Henry's attentions had very little to do with it. She would much rather not have been asked by him again so very soon, and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his previous inquiries of Norris, about the supper hour, were all for the sake of securing her at that part of the evening.
