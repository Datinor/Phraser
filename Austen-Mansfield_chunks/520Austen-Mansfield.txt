You must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me, What a piece of work here is about nothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort--so kind as they are to you! Take the part with a good grace, and let us hear no more of the matter, I entreat. Do not urge her, madam, It is not fair to urge her in this manner. You see she does not like to act. Let her chuse for herself, as well as the rest of us.
