That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing, in some measure, to a favourable difference of disposition and circumstance, but in a greater to her having been less the darling of that very aunt, less flattered and less spoilt.

Her temper was naturally the easiest of the two. her feelings, though quick, were more controllable, and education had not given her so very hurtful a degree of selfconsequence.
