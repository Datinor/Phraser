Grant, I believe, suspects him of a preference for Julia. I have never seen much symptom of it, but I wish it may be so. He has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove. If Miss Bertram were not engaged, I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia. Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you, Fanny, may be aware.
