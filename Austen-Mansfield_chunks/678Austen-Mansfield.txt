Dr. and Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father. Do you think so? in my opinion, my uncle would not like any addition. I think he values the very quietness you speak of, and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants. And it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be--I mean before my uncle went abroad.
