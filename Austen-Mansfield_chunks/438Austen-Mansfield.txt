What is there to surprise you in it? I think it would be very wrong. In a general light, private theatricals are open to some objections, but as we are circumstanced, I must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind. It would shew great want of feeling on my father's account, absent as he is, and in some degree of constant danger. and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whose situation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely delicate.
