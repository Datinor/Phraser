When I look out on such a night as this, I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world. and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene. I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree, as you do. who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in early life.
