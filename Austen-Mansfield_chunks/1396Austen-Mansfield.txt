Servants are come to such a pass, my dear, in Portsmouth, that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year. I have no hope of ever being settled. and if I was to part with Rebecca, I should only get something worse. And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please. and I am sure the place is easy enough, for there is always a girl under her, and I often do half the work myself.
