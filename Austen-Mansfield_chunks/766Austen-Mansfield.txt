Yes, ma'am, I should not think of anything else. And if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely, for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life, you must manage as well as you can, and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you. I certainly do not go home tonight, and, therefore, the carriage will not be out on my account. so you must make up your mind to what may happen, and take your things accordingly.   Her niece thought it perfectly reasonable.
