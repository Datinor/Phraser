Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct, who chose, instead of retaining his niece, to bring his mistress under his own roof. and to this Grant was indebted for her sister's proposal of coming to her, a measure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the other. for Grant, having by this time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the country without a family of children--having more than filled her favourite sittingroom with pretty furniture, and made a choice collection of plants and poultry--was very much in want of some variety at home. The arrival, therefore, of a sister whom she had always loved, and now hoped to retain with her as long as she remained single, was highly agreeable. and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield should not satisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to London.
