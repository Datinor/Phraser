William was required to be at Portsmouth on the 24th. the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his visit. but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix on any earlier. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just the same, and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself, as by far the best day for the purpose. The ball was now a settled thing, and before the evening a proclaimed thing to all whom it concerned.
