  This wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had just applied for permission to go to town with Maria. and as Sir Thomas thought it best for each daughter that the permission should be granted, Lady Bertram, though in her own goodnature she would not have prevented it, was lamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia's return, which would otherwise have taken place about this time. A great deal of good sense followed on Sir Thomas's side, tending to reconcile his wife to the arrangement. Everything that a considerate parent ought to feel was advanced for her use. and everything that an affectionate mother must feel in promoting her children's enjoyment was attributed to her nature.
