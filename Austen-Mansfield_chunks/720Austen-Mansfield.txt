To say the truth, I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.. and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it. If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home, that I should be spending month after month here, as I have done, I certainly should not have believed them. I have now been here nearly five months. and, moreover, the quietest five months I ever passed. Too quiet for you, I believe.
