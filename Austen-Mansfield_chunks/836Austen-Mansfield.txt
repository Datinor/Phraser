and Crawford does all the rest. Bertram, I have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home.  They had been hunting together, and were in the midst of a good run, and at some distance from Mansfield, when his horse being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had been obliged to give up, and make the best of his way back.  I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yewtrees, because I can never bear to ask. but I have not told you that, with my usual luck--for I never do wrong without gaining by it--I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see.
