I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood. but the next time we come to a seat, if it is not disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little while. how thoughtless I have been! I hope you are not very tired. Perhaps, my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm.
