Now, I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Fraser in consequence of his situation with you. When she comes to know the truth she will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again. for there is a daughter of Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get married, and wants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to such a degree.
