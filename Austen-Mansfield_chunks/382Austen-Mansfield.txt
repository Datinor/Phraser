There is a very good living kept for you, I understand, hereabouts. Which you suppose has biassed me? But that I am sure it has not, Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would affirm myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should.
