The mind which does not struggle against itself under one circumstance, would find objects to distract it in the other, I believe. and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with. The greater length of the service, however, I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind. One wishes it were not so. but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are.
