I cannot but say I much regret your being from home at this distressing time, so very trying to my spirits. I trust and hope, and sincerely wish you may never be absent from home so long again, When I go back into Northamptonshire, or when I return to Mansfield, I shall do so and so.

She reproached herself, coloured, and looked fearfully towards her father and mother.
