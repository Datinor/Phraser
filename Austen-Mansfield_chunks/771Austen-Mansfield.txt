The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin's marriage. I hope it is not too fine. but I thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could, and that I might not have such another opportunity all the winter. I hope you do not think me too fine. A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white.
