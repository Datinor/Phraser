There is one person in company who does not like to have Miss Price spoken of.   True enough, he had once seen Fanny dance. and it was equally true that he would now have answered for her gliding about with quiet, light elegance, and in admirable time. but, in fact, he could not for the life of him recall what her dancing had been, and rather took it for granted that she had been present than remembered anything about her. He passed, however, for an admirer of her dancing.
