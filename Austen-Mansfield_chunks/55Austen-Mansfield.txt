As for Fanny's being stupid at learning,  she could only say it was very unlucky, but some people were stupid, and Fanny must take more pains: she did not know what else was to be done. and, except her being so dull, she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing, and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages, and fetching what she wanted.   Fanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed at Mansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of her attachment to her former home, grew up there not unhappily among her cousins. There was no positive illnature in Maria or Julia.
