I am quite warm, very warm. Allow me to stay here a little while, and do have the goodness to hear me my third act. I have brought my book, and if you would but rehearse it with me, I should be so obliged! I came here today intending to rehearse it with Edmund--by ourselves--against the evening, but he is not in the way. and if he were, I do not think I could go through it with him, till I have hardened myself a little.
