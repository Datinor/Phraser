we sent a servant, we went ourselves: this will not do seventy miles from London. but this morning we heard of it in the right way. It was seen by some farmer, and he told the miller, and the miller told the butcher, and the butcher's soninlaw left word at the shop. I am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means, and hope there will be no further delay. I am to have it tomorrow.
