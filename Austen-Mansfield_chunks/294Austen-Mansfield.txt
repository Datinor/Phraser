This chapel was fitted up as you see it, in James the Second's time. Before that period, as I understand, the pews were only wainscot. and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth. but this is not quite certain. It is a handsome chapel, and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening.
