For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes, and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then. I wish you may not be fatigued by so much exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this walk home. No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you, I am very strong. Nothing ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like.
