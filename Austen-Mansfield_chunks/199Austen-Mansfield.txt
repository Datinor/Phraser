You have a large acquaintance in the navy, I conclude? Among admirals, large enough. but, we know very little of the inferior ranks. Postcaptains may be very good sort of men, but they do not belong to us. Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of their pay, and their bickerings and jealousies.
