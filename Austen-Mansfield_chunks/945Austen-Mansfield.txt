Her aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusual degree of wakefulness. It had really occurred to her, unprompted, that Fanny, preparing for a ball, might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid's, and when dressed herself, she actually sent her own maid to assist her. too late, of course, to be of any use. Chapman had just reached the attic floor, when Miss Price came out of her room completely dressed, and only civilities were necessary. but Fanny felt her aunt's attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Chapman could do themselves.
