My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm heart. and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing. So, if you are not against it, I will write to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal. and, as soon as matters are settled, I will engage to get the child to Mansfield. you shall have no trouble about it.
