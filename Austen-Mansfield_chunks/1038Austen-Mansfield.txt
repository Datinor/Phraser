You are not sensible of the gain, for your regard for him has blinded you. but, in my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you. To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture, would have broken my heart. Well, well, we do not think quite alike here. The Admiral has his faults, but he is a very good man, and has been more than a father to me.
