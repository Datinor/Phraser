I was suddenly, upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills. a small stream before me to be forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right--which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place, and not a gentleman or half a gentleman's house to be seen excepting one--to be presumed the Parsonage--within a stone's throw of the said knoll and church. I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey. It sounds like it, but which way did you turn after passing Sewell's farm? I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions.
