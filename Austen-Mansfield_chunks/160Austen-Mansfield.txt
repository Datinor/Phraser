The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well (and nothing was ever juster), tell one what is expected. but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them. I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September, just after my return from the West Indies. My friend Sneyd--you have heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund--his father, and mother, and sisters, were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place they were out.
