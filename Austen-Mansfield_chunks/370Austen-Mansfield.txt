My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old gardener would make me take. but if it is in your way, I will have it in my lap directly. There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me. take great care of it: do not let it fall. it is a cream cheese, just like the excellent one we had at dinner.
