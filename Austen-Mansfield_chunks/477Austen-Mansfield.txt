but I mean no disparagement to Julia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager's wife. and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old Butler. If the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it. and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous, let her take Cottager's speeches instead of Cottager's wife's, and so change the parts all through.
