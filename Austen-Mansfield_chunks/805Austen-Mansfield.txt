I have always thought her pretty--not strikingly pretty--but 'pretty enough,' as people say. a sort of beauty that grows on one. Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet smile. but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress, and your having nobody else to look at. and therefore, if you do set about a flirtation with her, you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty, or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly.
