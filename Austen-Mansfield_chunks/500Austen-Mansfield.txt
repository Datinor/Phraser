it is too far settled, everybody would be so disappointed, Tom would be quite angry. and if we are so very nice, we shall never act anything. I was just going to say the very same thing, If every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away, and I am sure that would be a discredit to us all. I do not know the play. but, as Maria says, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so with most of them) it can be easily left out.
