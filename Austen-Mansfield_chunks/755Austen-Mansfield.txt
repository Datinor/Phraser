So strange! for Grant never used to ask her. But is it not very natural, that Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister? Nothing can be more natural, nor, were there no sister in the case, could anything, in my opinion, be more natural. Grant's shewing civility to Miss Price, to Lady Bertram's niece, could never want explanation.
