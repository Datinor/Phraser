I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling, by an account of what he has felt. Suffice it, that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding, heart, and temper. Upon my representation of what you were suffering, he immediately, and with the greatest delicacy, ceased to urge to see you for the present.   Here Fanny, who had looked up, looked down again.  Of course, it cannot be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone, be it only for five minutes.
