It is amazing, how much young people cost their friends, what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world! They little think how much it comes to, or what their parents, or their uncles and aunts, pay for them in the course of the year. Now, here are my sister Price's children. take them all together, I dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say nothing of what I do for them. Very true, sister, as you say.
