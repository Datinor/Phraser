they leave Mansfield on Monday. I am glad of it. I am not comfortable enough to be fit for anybody. but your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my pen instead of hers.--Yours ever, my dearest Fanny. I never will, no, I certainly never will wish for a letter again, What do they bring but disappointment and sorrow?
