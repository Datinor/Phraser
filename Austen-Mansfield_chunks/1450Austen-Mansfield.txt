and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever, agreeable man, than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations. Crawford probably could not regard his future fatherinlaw with any idea of taking him for a model in dress. but (as Fanny instantly, and to her great relief, discerned) her father was a very different man, a very different Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected stranger, from what he was in his own family at home. His manners now, though not polished, were more than passable: they were grateful, animated, manly. his expressions were those of an attached father, and a sensible man.
