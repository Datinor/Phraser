My father wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he would never wish his grownup daughters to be acting plays. His sense of decorum is strict. I know all that, I know my father as well as you do. and I'll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him. Manage your own concerns, Edmund, and I'll take care of the rest of the family.
