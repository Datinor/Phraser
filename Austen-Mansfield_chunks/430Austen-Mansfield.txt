 Each sister could echo the wish. and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all the riot of his gratifications it was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the idea.  I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written, from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feel as if I could be anything or everything. as if I could rant and storm, or sigh or cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy in the English language.
