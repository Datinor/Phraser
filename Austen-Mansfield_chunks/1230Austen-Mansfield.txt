Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other? No, it is 'Fanny' that I think of all day, and dream of all night. You have given the name such reality of sweetness, that nothing else can now be descriptive of you.

The solemn procession, headed by Baddeley, of teaboard, urn, and cakebearers, made its appearance, and delivered her from a grievous imprisonment of body and mind.
