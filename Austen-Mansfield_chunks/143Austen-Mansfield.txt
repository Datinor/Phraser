The Miss Bertrams' admiration of Crawford was more rapturous than anything which Miss Crawford's habits made her likely to feel. She acknowledged, however, that the Bertrams were very fine young men, that two such young men were not often seen together even in London, and that their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very good. He had been much in London, and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred. and, indeed, his being the eldest was another strong claim. She had felt an early presentiment that she should like the eldest best.
