Yes, that is a place, indeed, and we had a charming day there. William, you are quite out of luck. but the next time you come, I hope dear and Rushworth will be at home, and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly received by both. Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations, and Rushworth is a most amiable man. They are at Brighton now, you know.
