he spoke to me on this subject yesterday, and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me, and quite out of my power to return his good opinion. I do not catch your meaning, Out of your power to return his good opinion? What is all this? I know he spoke to you yesterday, and (as far as I understand) received as much encouragement to proceed as a welljudging young woman could permit herself to give. I was very much pleased with what I collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion.
