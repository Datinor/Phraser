Ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements and dresses, rehearsals and jokes, was his neverfailing subject, and to boast of the past his only consolation. Happily for him, a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for acting so strong among young people, that he could hardly outtalk the interest of his hearers. From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue it was all bewitching, and there were few who did not wish to have been a party concerned, or would have hesitated to try their skill. The play had been Lovers' Vows, and Yates was to have been Count Cassel.  A trifling part, and not at all to my taste, and such a one as I certainly would not accept again.
