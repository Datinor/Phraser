I sat threequarters of an hour in the flowergarden, while Fanny cut the roses. and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. It was shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again. Fanny has been cutting roses, has she? Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year.
