That is exactly what I think, and what I was saying to my husband this morning. It will be an education for the child, said I, only being with her cousins. if Miss Lee taught her nothing, she would learn to be good and clever from them. I hope she will not tease my poor pug, I have but just got Julia to leave it alone. There will be some difficulty in our way, Norris, as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of their cousin.
