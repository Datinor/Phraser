I have no hope there, Fanny. If they persist in the scheme, they will find something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade them, and that is all I can do. I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side. I dare say she would, but she has no influence with either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use.
