Were you even less pleasing--supposing her not to love you already (of which, however, I can have little doubt)--you would be safe. The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately. From my soul I do not think she would marry you without love. that is, if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her. but ask her to love you, and she will never have the heart to refuse.
