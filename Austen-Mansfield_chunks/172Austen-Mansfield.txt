The tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam, The soil is good. and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering. Sir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park, and it cost us--that is, it was a present from Sir Thomas, but I saw the bill--and I know it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a Moor Park. You were imposed on, ma'am, these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree. It is an insipid fruit at the best.
