That she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise. for there is nothing in the course of one's duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning: seeing a great house, dawdling from one room to another, straining one's eyes and one's attention, hearing what one does not understand, admiring what one does not care for. It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price has found it so, though she did not know it. I shall soon be rested, to sit in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.   After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again.
