I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world. I have not lost a moment, however.

How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject, I will not attempt to describe. how severely mortified, how cruelly disappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London!
