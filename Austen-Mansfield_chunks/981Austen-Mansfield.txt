Last night it had been hope and smiles, bustle and motion, noise and brilliancy, in the drawingroom, and out of the drawingroom, and everywhere. Now it was languor, and all but solitude. A good night's rest improved her spirits. She could think of William the next day more cheerfully. and as the morning afforded her an opportunity of talking over Thursday night with Grant and Miss Crawford, in a very handsome style, with all the heightenings of imagination, and all the laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of a departed ball, she could afterwards bring her mind without much effort into its everyday state, and easily conform to the tranquillity of the present quiet week.
