for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time. It is about Lovers' Vows. I believe, there will be three acts rehearsed tomorrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once. You had better stay till the curtain is hung, the curtain will be hung in a day or two--there is very little sense in a play without a curtain--and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons.   Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting.
