I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly, and put everything at once on such a footing as cannot be afterwards swerved from. Maddison is a clever fellow. I do not wish to displace him, provided he does not try to displace me. but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me, and worse than simple to let him give me a hardhearted, griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man, to whom I have given half a promise already. Would it not be worse than simple?
