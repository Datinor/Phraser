My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble.   So long divided and so differently situated, the ties of blood were little more than nothing. An attachment, originally as tranquil as their tempers, was now become a mere name. Price did quite as much for Lady Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Price. Three or four Prices might have been swept away, any or all except Fanny and William, and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it.
