How long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England, with the dates of their accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns! Yes, and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus. besides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals, semimetals, planets, and distinguished philosophers. Very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderful memories, and your poor cousin has probably none at all. There is a vast deal of difference in memories, as well as in everything else, and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin, and pity her deficiency.
