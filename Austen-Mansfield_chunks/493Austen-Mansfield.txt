It will not be necessary to send you to your father's judgment, I am convinced. We see things very differently, I am perfectly acquainted with the play, I assure you. and with a very few omissions, and so forth, which will be made, of course, I can see nothing objectionable in it. and I am not the only young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation. I am sorry for it, but in this matter it is you who are to lead.
