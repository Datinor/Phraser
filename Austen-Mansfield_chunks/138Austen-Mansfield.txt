I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion, or accomplishment, or good quality in the person, who have found themselves entirely deceived, and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse. What is this but a take in? My dear child, there must be a little imagination here. I beg your pardon, but I cannot quite believe you.
