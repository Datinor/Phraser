I used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance. but in that soft skin of hers, so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday, there is decided beauty. and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth, I do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express. And then, her air, her manner, her tout ensemble, is so indescribably improved! She must be grown two inches, at least, since October.
