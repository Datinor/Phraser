I should dearly love to settle you both in this country. and therefore, Henry, you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice, handsome, goodhumoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very happy.   Henry bowed and thanked her.   My dear sister, if you can persuade him into anything of the sort, it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever, and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of. If you can persuade Henry to marry, you must have the address of a Frenchwoman.
