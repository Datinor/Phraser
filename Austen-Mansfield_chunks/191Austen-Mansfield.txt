As for Dr. Grant's bailiff, I believe I had better keep out of his way. and my brotherinlaw himself, who is all kindness in general, looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at. You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before. but when you do think of it, you must see the importance of getting in the grass. The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose: our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out.
