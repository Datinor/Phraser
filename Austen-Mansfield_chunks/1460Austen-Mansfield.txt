to think that where nature had made so little difference, circumstances should have made so much, and that her mother, as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior, should have an appearance so much more worn and faded, so comfortless, so slatternly, so shabby. But Sunday made her a very creditable and tolerably cheerfullooking Price, coming abroad with a fine family of children, feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only discomposed if she saw her boys run into danger, or Rebecca pass by with a flower in her hat. In chapel they were obliged to divide, but Crawford took care not to be divided from the female branch. and after chapel he still continued with them, and made one in the family party on the ramparts. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sunday throughout the year, always going directly after morning service and staying till dinnertime.
