Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon, Miss Crawford, except riding. How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did all last week! I am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen again. Your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect. Fanny's interest seems in safer hands with you than with me.
