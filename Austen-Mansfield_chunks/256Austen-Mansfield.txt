She has not been out on horseback now this long while, and I am persuaded that, when she does not ride, she ought to walk. If she had been riding before, I should not have asked it of her. But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses. for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind. and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.
