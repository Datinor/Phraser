I believe we must be satisfied with less, There would not be time, and other difficulties would arise. We must rather adopt Crawford's views, and make the performance, not the theatre, our object. Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery. Nay, Let us do nothing by halves. If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from beginning to end.
