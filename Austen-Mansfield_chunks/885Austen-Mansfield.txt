If they were at home to grace the ball, a ball you would have this very Christmas. Thank your uncle, William, thank your uncle! My daughters, have their pleasures at Brighton, and I hope are very happy. but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins. Could we be all assembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete, but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement.
