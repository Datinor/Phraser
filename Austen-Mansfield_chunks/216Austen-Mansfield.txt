She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection. Yes, except as to his writing her such short letters. She made me almost laugh. but I cannot rate so very highly the love or goodnature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters, when they are separated. I am sure William would never have used me so, under any circumstances.
