The place deserves it, Bertram. You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman's residence. That will be done by the removal of the farmyard. for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman's residence, so much the look of a something above a mere parsonagehouse--above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as windows.
