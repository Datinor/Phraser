Well, Edmund, but this I will maintain, that we shall be doing no harm. I cannot agree with you. I am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it. And I am convinced to the contrary. Nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father, and for anything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always a decided taste.
