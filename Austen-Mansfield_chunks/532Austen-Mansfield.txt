Everything was a friend, or bore her thoughts to a friend. and though there had been sometimes much of suffering to her. though her motives had often been misunderstood, her feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued. though she had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt Bertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what was yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and her friend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had told her not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears delightful. and the whole was now so blended together, so harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.
