You will find the beginning of a note to yourself. but I can now speak my business, which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle--a chain for William's cross. You ought to have had it a week ago, but there has been a delay from my brother's not being in town by several days so soon as I expected. and I have only just now received it at Northampton. I hope you will like the chain itself, Fanny.
