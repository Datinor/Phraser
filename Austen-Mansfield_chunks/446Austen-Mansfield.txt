If you are resolved on acting, I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way. and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted. It would be taking liberties with my father's house in his absence which could not be justified. For everything of that nature I will be answerable, His house shall not be hurt. I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have.
