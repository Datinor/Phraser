To own the truth, Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose, which he could not get the better of. My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it. I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of selfindulgence. and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours.
