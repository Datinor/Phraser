This is not behaving well by the absent, Here are not women enough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is nothing for your sister, Crawford.   Crawford desired that might not be thought of: he was very sure his sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful, and that she would not allow herself to be considered in the present case. But this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of Amelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she would accept it.  It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her, as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters.
