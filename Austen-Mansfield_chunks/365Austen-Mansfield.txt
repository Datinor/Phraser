On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, Rushworth and Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for the wilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the house. Norris had been too well employed to move faster. Whatever crossaccidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces, she had found a morning of complete enjoyment. for the housekeeper, after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken her to the dairy, told her all about their cows, and given her the receipt for a famous cream cheese. and since Julia's leaving them they had been met by the gardener, with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance, for she had set him right as to his grandson's illness, convinced him that it was an ague, and promised him a charm for it.
