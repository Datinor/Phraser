We may be trusted, I think, in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable. and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own. I have no fears and no scruples. And as to my father's being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I consider it rather as a motive. for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother.
