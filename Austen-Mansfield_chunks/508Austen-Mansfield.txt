Rushworth was to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt. I had my choice of the parts, but I thought I should like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I am to have. You chose very wisely, I am sure, Anhalt is a heavy part. The Count has twoandforty speeches, which is no trifle. I am not at all surprised, at this want of an Anhalt.
