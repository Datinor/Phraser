Yes. Don't be affronted, but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits in a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return. There is no sacrifice in the case, it is entirely her own doing. Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking.
