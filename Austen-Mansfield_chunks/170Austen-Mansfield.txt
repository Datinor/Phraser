It wants improvement, ma'am, beyond anything. I never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life. and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done with it. No wonder that Rushworth should think so at present, but depend upon it, Sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire. I must try to do something with it, but I do not know what.
