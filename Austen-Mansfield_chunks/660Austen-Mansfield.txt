You know the distance to Sotherton. it was in the middle of winter, and the roads almost impassable, but I did persuade her. I know how great, how justly great, your influence is with Lady Bertram and her children, and am the more concerned that it should not have been. My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the roads that day! I thought we should never have got through them, though we had the four horses of course.
