Any room in this house might suffice. We must have a curtain, a few yards of green baize for a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough. Oh, quite enough, with only just a side wing or two run up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be let down. nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this. For mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more.
